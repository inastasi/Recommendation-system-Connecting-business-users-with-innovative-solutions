SOL-27358,"There is a plugin Office called "" Dictate"" . It can be downloaded from this Microsoft website ( dictate.ms ) . Using this plugin Office programs (Outlook,Word,Powerpoint...) can write automatically or translate. in another Language. The benefit is that for an Enel employee, is easier and faster, to think a document and to speak to this ""digital secretary"", then to type on the desk. To be more clearer, please look at this 2 youtube walk-through videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auF9bvAectU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9gCfEJGj38"
SOL-86113,"My vacuum cleaner will consist of an enlarge intake using just a foam in order to prevent a drop or reduction in the suction pressure as pre-filter and water as the final filter. Using a vacuum cleaner filter exhales air that is smaller than 0.3 micron. The smallest particle emitted by vacuum cleaners using a HEPA filter. HEPA stands for high-efficiency particulate air. Any particles smaller than 0.3 micron remain untouched. Using water as the final filter will further clean the exhaled air by reducing the particles smaller than 0.3 micron by absorbing these particles. Any particles exhaled by the pre-filter will be absorbed by the final filter which is the water. Using water as the final filter will somehow reduce the suction of the vacuum cleaner due to the weight of the water so it is better to limit the reduction in suction pressure by 8% (percent) only. The typical suction pressure of a vacuum cleaner is up to 20 kPa. This means that our vacuum cleaner will have a suction pressure up to 18.4 kPa only. An 18.4 kPa suction pressure is still as strong as the common vacuum cleaner, nevertheless, we can always create a vacuum pump and a motor with higher rpm in order to match the suction pressure of common vacuum cleaner which is up to 20 kPa. Although the water as the final filter cannot fully eliminate the particles smaller than 0.3 micron, the idea is to reduce them. As a result, my vacuum cleaner will exhale an air that is cleaner than the common vacuum cleaner. The water filter may be changed when its color turns from clear into brown or as the user desires. HEPA filters for vacuum cleaner could cost up to 8 dollars each. But my vacuum cleaner requires only a suitable amount of foam as pre-filter and water as the final filter which is way farther below than 8 dollars.This is an improvement in installation and maintenance cost since you could only spend just almost a cent or two for the foam and use a tap water for the water filter. This is also an improvement in energy consumption since your vacuum cleaner will exhale particles smaller than 0.3 micron using the same vacuum cleaner power but with the air filtration efficiency increased. Even if we create a stronger motor, it is meant only to eliminate the reduction in pressure created by the water filter which is just 8% (percent) of 20 kPa. Also, the pre-filter will serve the final filter for many purposes because a pre-filter is known to be manipulable for the compatibility of the final filter. As a result, the overall maintenance cost and efficiency of a vacuum cleaner is improved, leaving not just a smarter home, but offices and industry also for the rest of time. Attached is the jpg and .dwg file diagram of the vacuum cleaner only of how the system will work but does not represent real structure of the device. This is the first in the world so I was advised to have the idea patented but you'll have to wait if you want a patent. I'm using an AutoCAD 2020 which is incompatible with older versions."

SOL-86116,"La proposta di soluzione si basa sull'idea di diminuire lo spazio occupato dai normali pannelli fotovoltaici, tale spazio se considerevolmente diminuito permetterebbe una minore necessità di desertificazione e una maggiore possibilità di coltivazione per la comunità locale. L'idea si basa sulla produzione di un pannello (in silicio o con materiali di ultima generazione) a forma di spirale, questa, costantemente in rotazione sul proprio asse centrale e inserita in una concavità in metallo riflettente, permetterebbe di ridurre lo spazio occupato dal nuovo pannello ideato mantenendo la stessa superficie di silicio (o materiale simile) in esposizione alla luce (fotoni derivanti direttamente dai raggi solari o di rimbalzo per effetto del pannello riflettente). Se sulla forma a spirale invece del consueto pannello in silicio si inserissero delle forme a cono (la cui superficie laterale è maggiore della superficie di base) si potrebbe ulteriormente aumentare lo spazio di superficie esposto ai fotoni sullo stesso spazio occupato dal pannello descritto precedentemente. Queste strutture coniche possono ruotare, per non raggiungere una temperatura troppo elevata, sul loro stesso asse. Alcune strutture simili sono già state prodotte. La potenza prodotta risulta maggiore dei normali pannelli solari."
SOL-86117,"Babelus is a Supplier Hunting On-Demand service that operates under the BPaaS model (BPO+software as a service) and allows utilities to recruit and filter suppliers of materials and services anywhere in the world, eliminating the bottleneck in the Scouting process. As a cloud services provider, we offer the end-to-end solution that enables partial or complete outsourcing of the scouting process (KPO). This procurement engineering service reduces the time spent by the utility by up to 85% and dramatically shortens the supplier sourcing process. 1. We perform a meta search on the most important portals in the world, specialized reports and information on the internet, as well as consultations with other utilities, peers and contractors. 2. The ""recruited"" suppliers are filtered through an RFI/RFP/RFT process. Thus, the utility invites only those ""qualifying"" companies to register on its procurement portal. 3. The utility not only saves hundreds of hours in this activity, but moves faster. 4.The information is delivered within the platform, where the buyer accesses the recruited suppliers and logs the RFX processes, living an experience comparable to Trivago. 5. As an additional benefit, the service includes access to the Babelus marketplace and RFx modules, which allows running RFI events, RFP and request for guaranteed technical data."
SOL-86118,"The basic operating principle of a fly-wheel battery is to absorb energy from a source in order to recharge itself, and to store energy in form of kinetic rotational energy that is supplied when needed. The innovative Steel Energy technology is born from the utilization of a special oleo-dynamic support for the fly-wheel suspension (internationally patent protected). The new oleo-dynamic support has allowed the complete review of the operating logics of the battery, setting itself apart from competitors. The oleo-dynamic support allows the rotor to bear significant weights with low energy usage (about 1% of the energy that can be accumulated). The potential increase of the rotor?s weight allows the upwards scalability of the energy that can be stored and at the same time, it allows to keep a relatively low rotation speed (about 3.000 rpm), improving the system safety. In this regard reference is made in the CESI studies."
SOL-86121,"Since the use of lampposts and pillar fencing for sidewalks is not welcome, either existing trees or artificial ones remain the only alternative. Since the charging poles of the ground will be subject to clogging, flooding and frequent breakdowns. Two versions are possible - these are belts for already existing living trees or the installation of completely new artificial trees. On the belts for living trees, imitation of chopped branches will be installed, in which charging plugs will be placed. On artificial palms there will be an imitation of chopped stalks. Charging plugs will be installed below them. Of course, artificial trees can be of other types - not just palm trees. With regard to the technical side of things. That charging stations do the manufacturers of electric vehicles. It makes no sense to reinvent them. They can be hidden in the ground at the base of trees - hermetically, of course. This arrangement allows you to use long cables, the color of which will also be imitated by the color of the trees. The price of trees and belts will be the same as in other cases, they will simply be equipped with additional equipment, the price of which depends on the manufacturer. Of course, my artistic abilities do not cause delight, but it will probably be better if the artists of those cities where such trees are installed are borrowed with the design issue."
